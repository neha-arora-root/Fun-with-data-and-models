FACIAL RECOGNITION  

Facial Recognition has gained a lot of popularity for different applications, especially as the power of compute has become promisingly more attainable. The subject is being widely studied and facial recognition has two different varieties:  
1) There’s an online, computer-augmented form: Can software identify you from a picture uploaded to Facebook?  
2) And there’s an offline, “in the wild” form: Can software identify you by taking your picture while you’re just walking around?  

While near human accuracy has been achieved for online facial recognition, a lot needs to be done for offline version. In my attempt to understand the presently followed techniques and build on it further, I am trying to learn from the following algorithms:  

- Principal Component Analysis (Eigenfaces)  
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)  
- Elastic Bunch Graph Matching (Fisherface algorithm)  
- Hidden Markov Model  
- Multilinear Subspace Learning (tensor representation)  
- Dynamic Link Matching (neuronal motivated)
